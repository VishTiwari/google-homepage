I built google's homepage using CSS and HTML! 

It is a rough version with demonstrating use of DIVs, links to images, positioning, color, and learning how to use visual studio/terminal to upload to github.

Future work: the landing page still needs a lot of work in terms of positioning but I just wanted to get something semi-functional to test out some HTML/CSS skills.
